Project utilizes the Pyrogram library for interacting with cryptocurrency exchange APIs and retrieving real-time data on prices and trading volumes. We also make use of the pydantic library for validating and structuring the collected data.

- Pyrogram Library:
  The Pyrogram library is used for communication with cryptocurrency exchange APIs, allowing us to fetch up-to-date data on cryptocurrency prices and trading volumes.

- Pydantic Library:
  Pydantic is employed for validating and structuring the collected data. It enables us to create data models with defined fields and validation rules to effectively process and analyze information about historical prices, trading volumes, and other key metrics of cryptocurrencies.

Our project serves as a valuable tool for users to track cryptocurrency price changes in real-time, make forecasts, and take informed decisions when trading on exchanges. By providing a user-friendly and functional platform for working with cryptocurrency data, we aim to empower users to make successful investment decisions and optimize their trading strategies.
